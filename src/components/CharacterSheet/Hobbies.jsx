                            <p>Since I graduated from secondary school, I've been interested in creative writing. As early as a child I was raised on young adult fantasy novels such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Icemark_Chronicles">Icemark Chronicles</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_Fell">Troll trilogy</a>.</p>
                            <p>I took part in my first NaNoWriMo(National Novel Writing Month), an excercise to write 50k words within a single month back in 2016 and found I quite enjoyed creative writing even if I was abysmall at it.</p>
                            <p>But what I found was that I gradually improved as a writer, and practice today means I will be a bit better than yesterday, and practice tomorrow means I'll be slightly better than today.</p>

                            <p>The problem solving aspect of software engineering is quite appealing. It's rewarding to create workable solutions to problems and learn new frameworks.</p>
                            <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading works by professionals and believe that <a href="https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29">Clean Code</a> is a must read for any developer producing code in mission critical systems.</p>
                            <p>This website is one of the products of my light attempt to learn React. This isn't just a professional skill for me, it is genuinely something I enjoy.</p>
