            <summary>React - Personal Website</summary>

            <p>In an effort to produce an online portfolio, a place to show my projects and such, and indulge in a bit of learning, I decided to take a look at React. This website was produced using React. It's hosted on a VPS and any changes made to the repository on GitHub can be pushed to the VPS using a deployment job through Github Actions.</p>                
            <p>The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/TheGwionInGlasses/Online-Portfolio">here</a>.</p>
